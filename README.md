# Building
TIKdevil depends on [libctru](https://github.com/smealum/ctrulib) and a git submodule that will need to be fetched.

When initially fetching the project, the easiest way to get the code and submodules for building is the following:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/Kyraminol/TIKdevil.git`

If you have already checked out the code without the submodules, you can run the following command in the project directory to fetch the submodule data:

`git submodule update --init --recursive`
